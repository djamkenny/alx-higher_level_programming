# This file 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

In this project, I understand and practiced the python data structures: List and tuples.

You will find the Function Prototypes in the lists.h file.

```0-print_list_integer.py```

Print a list of integers

Python function that prints all integers of a list

```1-element_at.py```

Secure access to an element in a list

Python function that retrieves an element from a list like in C

```2-replace_in_list.py```

Replace element

Python function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C)

```3-print_reversed_list_integer.py```

Print a list of integers... in reverse!

Python function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order

```4-new_in_list.py```

Replace in a copy

Python function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C)
