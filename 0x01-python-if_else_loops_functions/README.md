0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

In this project, I demonstrate conditionals and loops in Python by using if, if ... else, break, continue, pass, and range statements with while and for loops. Moreover, I practiced writing user defined (my own) Python functions while learning about scope of variables, tracebacks, and arithmetic operators.

You will find the Function Prototypes in the lists.h file.

```0-positive_or_negative.py```
Positive anything is better than negative nothing

This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.

```1-last_digit.py```
The last digit

This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.

```1-last_digit.py```
The last digit

This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.

```2-print_alphabet.py```
I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

```3-print_alphabt.py```
When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off

Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

```4-print_hexa.py```
Hexadecimal printing

Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example)

```5-print_comb2.py```
 00...99

Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.

```6-print_comb3.py```
Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need

Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
